  <p class="para">
    Nowadays we have many kinds of websites providing a platform for users to ask questions and share
    experiences such as Quora and Zhihu. But many person around me always complain that if they want
    to search a specific learning stuff on these sites, the results are sometimes confusing, they still have no
    idea where to start learning. So Shihao Xia (charlesxsh.github.io) and I want to make a website for users to share learning
    paths step by step. In our website, users can search for the learning path they want and check out the
    results in a much clearer way.
  </p>

<section id="prototype">
  <h1 class="title">HomePage</h1>
  <p class="intro para">While sketching out the wireframe of the home page, I used different color representing different areas and
    provided three designs as follows:</p>
  <img class="img-responsive proto" alt="homepageproto.jpg" src="../images/home3.jpg"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">I did a preference test on 42 testers from different countries, ages, and jobs and let them choose their
    favorite and most dislike home page design and also give me choosing reason and feedback. The result turned out to be 15
    testers preferred the first design, 4 testers preferred the second design, and 13 testers preferred the last one. The number
    of testers who preferred the first one and last one are too close.<br><br>
    Also in the feedback comments they provided, I realized that those testers who didn’t like the first design mostly because
    they thought the user-info section floating on the right was discordant; those testers who didn’t like the second design
    mostly because there were too much information on the homepage and the main part was not straightforward enough; those
    testers who didn’t like the third design mostly because, although the interface looked clean, the position of searching
    bar was a little bit discordant. And another two common feedbacks were moving the postion of “DownloadApp”, “About US”
    and “Contact Us” to the footer of the website avoiding distraction and the position of top three buttons “Ask” “Answer”
    “Share Path” were not comfortable.<br><br>
    Based on all the information I gained, I modified my home page with the fourth design and then created the prototype base
    on it and built its final UI as follows: </p>
  <br><br>
  <img style="width: 100%" class="img-responsive" alt="home.jpg" src="../images/home33.png"/>
</section>
<section id="testing">
  <h1 class="title">Trend</h1>
  <p class="intro para">I designed two types of Trend page and tested on the same group of testers:</p>
  <img class="img-responsive proto" alt=trendproto.jpg" src="../images/trend-pro.jpg"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">As a result, 35 testers preferred the first design. Their comments on the second one was too much spaces wasted.
    So I designed the Trend page based on the left design and created the final UI. Trend page has three parts: Question,
    Path and Topic, which represent the most popular questions, paths, and topics seperately. </p>
  <br><br>
  <img style="width: 100%" class="img-responsive" alt="trend-question.jpg" src="../images/trend1.png"/>
  <br><br>
  <img style="width: 100%" class="img-responsive" alt="trend-topic.jpg" src="../images/trend2.png"/>
</section>
<section style="margin: 4rem" id="path-detail">
  <h1 class="title">Path</h1>
  <p class="intro para">Users can not only ask/answer questions like Quora, but also share their own learning path. Here are my
    design for adding path page and path detail page.</p>
  <img class="img-responsive proto" alt="addpath.jpg" src="../images/add-path.png"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">As for adding path page, user can type title and step detail to share paths, can click ADD to add one
    more step and click REMOVE to delete the last step.<br><br>
    The path detail looks like:</p>
  <br><br>
  <img class="img-responsive" alt="path-detail.jpg" src="../images/path-detail.png"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">
    I put the location-like icon in the front of each step and make the whole path looks more like “step by step”.
  </p>
</section>
<section id="final">
  <h1 class="title">Final</h1>
  <p class="para">After testing every single page, I finished the design of Path and started working on the front-end developing
    part. I decided to use Angularjs as js framework and Bootstrap as css framework.</p>
