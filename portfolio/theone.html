  <h1 class="title">Inspiration</h1>
  <p class="para">
    Nowadays there are numerous couple-oriented apps in worldwide application stores with various features.
    After doing a marketing research on 100 couples who have used couple-oriented apps before, I noticed
    that, most couples only use a few features frequently so that many other features are useless in those apps.<br><br>
    For example, although this kind of apps always have “chatting” feature, couples still prefer major chatting
    apps such as Wechat in China. Although many couple-oriented apps have “Community” feature to let users
    share their stories with other couples, users still prefer sharing their love stories and daily lives on Instagram,
    twitter, facebook, etc.<br><br>
    Also I realized that users complain a lot about those useless in-app purchase and endless ads.<br><br>
    So I decided to make a brand new app, which has only useful features and “clean” interfaces with my boyfriend
    who can help me with developing.<br><br>
    Finally, let me talk about the name. “THEONE” represents not only every user has only one “friend” in this app,
    but also the “fatal” person in the user’s life. The slogan on the welcome page, “Once start, never end” implies
    that we hope every couple starting an relationship will never end it, and also every user starting using our app
    will never stop using it.<br>
  </p>

<section id="prototype">
  <h1 class="title">Prototype</h1>
  <p class="intro para">I designed both iOS and Website of TheOne but our web app still need more considerations so I only display
    iOS related design here.<br><br>
    First of all, I designed the welcome and login/register interface:</p>
  <img class="img-responsive proto" alt="welcome-sketch.jpg" src="../images/welcom-skt.jpg"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">And then I started the home page design which took me a while. I provided four types of different styles of the
    home page listed belows:<br><br>
    I tried to add some “couple”-focus elements in the first design. So I listed all eight features and masked “heart” shape graphs
    for each of them.<br>
    In my second design, I wanted to make eight features display like a circle and put a photograph of couple in the
    middle of the home page.<br>
    As for the third design, I listed every features one by one as blocks and added different backgrounds closely
    related to all features separately.<br>
    In my last design of home page, users can set a photograph by themselves as the background and all the
    features would display inline at the bottom part of the page.<br><br>
    Finally I picked the third one from them after discussing with both my advisors and my developer.</p>
  <br><br>
  <img class="img-responsive" alt="home-sketch.jpg" src="../images/home-skt.png"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">
    Then I just started feature design part, and listed some sketched wireframes here:
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <img class="img-responsive" alt="features-sketch.jpg" src="../images/feature-skt.jpg"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">
    Now I’m trying to make brief introduction to the design behind every feature seperately.<br><br>
    - The first one is wish list, which is quite straightforward. Users can add any wishes into the wish list in “dialog”
    style, which is easy to recognize which wish list belongs to whom.<br><br>
    - The second one is EatPick, which is another app I designed. It’s a common situation that couples who live
    together everyday always have trouble with deciding where to eat. Sometimes they are bored of cooking at
    home and want to eat outside but cannot make decisions picking one from numerous restaurants. In THEONE.
    this feature will simply lead users to download and use EatPick to solve this problem.<br><br>
    - The third one is private album. Here users can upload photos and descriptions which are only visible between
    couples themselves.<br><br>
    - The fourth one is remote alarm clock. If users are far away from their partners but still need to wake him/her up
    in the morning or be waken by partners at some time, they can just set an alarm clock. For example one user
    set an alarm clock at 08:00 am to wake his girlfriend. When it is 08:00 am, THEONE will send this user an
    reminder of waking up his girlfriend, so that he can do this within one click and will never miss it.<br><br>
    - The fifth one is location sharing. It has two button: send and request. Users can send the current location clicking
    “send” button and request his/her partner to send location clicking “request” button.<br><br>
    - The sixth one is days reminder. Girls are always complaining about their boyfriends never remember their
    anniversaries or other significant days. So we add this feature counting days for couples. When those important
    days are coming, both users will get a reminder.<br><br>
    - The last two are trends about what he/she likes. Girls will find out what their boyfriends or husbands like in
    ForHim feature. Boys will find out what their girlfriends or wives like in ForHer feature. With the help of these two
    features, it’s much easier for users to choose gifts or prepare surprises for their partners.<br>
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <img class="img-responsive" alt="settings-sketch.jpg" src="../images/setting-skt.jpg"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">
    The wireframes above are other interface designs. But in order to make the side menu more consise, I changed
    the personal information on the top part to place to a place holding a photograph of couple and moved personal information
    into setting page.<br><br>
    One more thing need to be mentioned is: there is an “End
    Relationship” feature. If users really want to break up with their partners, they can find this feature in Partner
    Information tab. But we hope users will never use this feature!<br><br>
    After completing wireframes, I started the prototype design in Sketch App. I choose blue and pink as major
    colors besides white in my app design.<br>
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <img class="img-responsive" alt="home.jpg" src="../images/welcome.png"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">
    What I list below are the home page, side menu, and other features that need users to scroll down to view:
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <img class="img-responsive" alt="home.jpg" src="../images/home.png"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">
    Finally here come my eight prototypes of feature design:
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <img class="img-responsive" alt="features.jpg" src="../images/feature-proto.png"/>
  <br><br>
</section>
<section id="testing">
  <h1 class="title">Testing</h1>
  <p class="para">
    I tested my prototype design on 45 couples in different types: some of them were together for only
    a few days, some of them had been together for more than four years; some of them lived with partners
    everyday but some others were staying in a long-distance relationship for several years.<br><br>
    I gained lots of useful results from them and want to talk about login interface and alarm clock here.<br><br>
    After uploading my login interface to Dribbble, I got a comment that maybe solid button for sign in with Facebook
    and Wechat is better. So I did an A/B testing on this interface contains original version and solid-style button version
    as follows:
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <img class="img-responsive" alt="abtest.jpg" src="../images/abtest.png"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">
    As a result, the right one is the winner. Testers all agree that “sign in with Facebook” and “sign in with Wechat” in
    the left original design looks like input area.<br><br>

    I also provided two design of the alarm clock setting interface:
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <img class="img-responsive" alt="clock.jpg" src="../images/clock.png"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">
    The Add Alarm interface has four main parts: setting time, repeat, from whom and to whom. At first I thought
    users may find “from whom” and “to whom” hard to understand, or the way setting alarm clock in the right
    design may be hard to understand. But it seems that all testers can figure out how to use and most of them
    prefer the right design.

  <h1 class="title">Final</h1>
  <p class="para">After having some more considerations by myself and discussions with my advisors and developers, I finally
    finished THEONE iOS app design. And the iOS developer is working on it now. I displayed some mock-up
    features belows: </p>
