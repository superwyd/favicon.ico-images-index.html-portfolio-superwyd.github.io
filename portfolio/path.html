    Nowadays we have many kinds of websites providing platforms for users to ask questions and share
    experiences such as Quora and Zhihu. But many friends around me always complain that if they want
    to search a specific learning process on these sites, the results are sometimes confusing, they still have no
    idea where to start learning.<span> So Shihao Xia and I want to make a website to solve this issue by letting users
    share learning paths step by step.</span> In Path, users can search for the learning path they want and check out the
    results in a much clearer way.

  <h1 class="title">Persona</h1>
  <p class="para">Before starting this project, I did a marketing survey on 60 person from different countries, ages, and jobs and
    generated the following three personas which can represent our target users most clearly:</p><br><br>
  <img class="img-responsive single" alt="case1.png" src="../images/case1.png"/><br><br>
  <img class="img-responsive single" alt="case2.png" src="../images/case2.png"/><br><br>
  <img class="img-responsive single" alt="case3.png" src="../images/case3.png"/><br><br>
</section>
<section id="prototype" class="middle">
  <h1 class="title">HomePage</h1>
  <p class="intro para">While sketching out the wireframe of the home page, I used different color representing different areas and
    provided three designs as follows:</p><br><br>
  <img class="img-responsive proto" alt="homepageproto.jpg" src="../images/home3.jpg"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">I did a preference test on those 60 person again and let them choose their
    favorite and most dislike home page design as well as give me choosing reason and feedback. The result turned out to be 29 testers preferred the first design, 4 testers preferred the second design, and 27 testers preferred the last one. The number of testers who preferred the first one and last one are too close.
    <br><br>
    Also in the feedback comments they provided, I realized that those testers who didn’t like the first design mostly because they thought the user-info section floating on the right was redundant; those testers who didn’t like the second design mostly because there were too much information on the homepage and the main part was not straightforward enough; those testers who didn’t like the third design mostly because, although the interface looked clean, the position of searching bar was a little bit discordant. And another two common feedbacks were the postion of “DownloadApp”, “About US” and “Contact Us” are distractive and the position of top three buttons “Ask” “Answer” “Share Path” were not comfortable.
    <br><br>
    Based on all the information I gained, I modified my home page with the fourth design and then created the mockup base on it and built the prototype with HTML and Bootstrap CSS framework as follows: </p>
  <br><br>
  <img style="width: 100%" class="img-responsive" alt="home.jpg" src="../images/home33.png"/><br><br>
  <p class="para"> Once I had the prototype, I did a testing on my 60 testers again and gained lots of useful feedback
  from them:<br><br>
  - Topic tags attract too more attention than the main contents.<br>
  - Vote feature is inconspicuous.<br>
  - ReadMore button seems discordant and a little bit mess.<br>
  - Add button in navigation bar is confusing if don’t drop it down.<br><br>
  Based on their feedback and my reconsideration, I designed a new version of homepage. Everything looks nice
  to me except the vote bar. I came up with two kinds of vote bar and did an A/B testing on them as follows:</p><br><br>
  <img style="width: 100%" class="img-responsive proto" alt="homepageproto.jpg" src="../images/home-2.png"/><br><br>
  <p class="para">
    The result gaining from my testers showed that, 80% of tester who are elder than 25 preferred the right
    version (B), while the preference between left and right was 50% and 50% for testers younger than 25. As the
    consideration that our website was large age range oriented, I picked the right version.
    <br><br>
    When I thought everything all set, I just came up with an idea that, in the current voting design, users can "upvote"
    or "downvote" a path showing their likes or dislikes, but those “dislikes” may hurt the author who spent a long time
    writing the path. So I remove the “downvote” button.
  </p>
  <img class="img-responsive proto single" alt="homepageproto.jpg" src="../images/home-draft3.png"/><br><br>
  <p class="para">
    The prototype above is my final homepage design and I’m going to go over other pages in the following sections.
  </p>
  <br>
</section>
<section id="testing" class="middle">
  <h1 class="title">Trend</h1>
  <p class="intro para">I designed two types of Trend page and tested on the same group of testers:</p>
  <img class="img-responsive proto" alt=trendproto.jpg" src="../images/trend-pro.jpg"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">As a result, 35 testers preferred the first design. Their comments on the second one was too much spaces wasted.
    So I designed the Trend page based on the left design and created the final UI. Trend page has three parts: Question,
    Path and Topic, which represent the most popular questions, paths, and topics separately. </p>
  <br><br>
  <img style="width: 100%" class="img-responsive" alt="trend-question.jpg" src="../images/trend1.png"/>
  <br><br>
  <img style="width: 100%" class="img-responsive" alt="trend-topic.jpg" src="../images/trend2.png"/>
</section>
<section id="path-detail" class="middle">
  <h1 class="title">Path</h1>
  <p class="intro para">Users can not only ask/answer questions like Quora, but also share their own learning path. Here are my
    design for adding path page and path detail page.</p>
  <img class="img-responsive proto single" alt="addpath.jpg" src="../images/add-path.png"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">As for adding path page, user can type title and step detail to share paths, can click ADD to add one
    more step and click REMOVE to delete the last step.<br><br>
    The path detail looks like:</p>
  <br><br>
  <img class="img-responsive single" alt="path-detail.jpg" src="../images/path-detail.png"/>
  <br><br>
  <p class="para">
    I put the location-like icon in the front of each step and make the whole path looks more like “step by step”.
  </p>
</section>
<section id="final" class="middle">
  <h1 class="title">Final</h1>
  <p class="para">After testing every single page, I finished the design of Path and started working on the front-end developing
    part. I decided to use Angularjs as js framework and Bootstrap as css framework.</p>
